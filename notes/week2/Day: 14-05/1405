I continu to work on my dataset I will try to generate multiple datasets, big and small to see what is the best for the task.
qwen is not good for this task I think I need a model that don't. Liama 3.2 seems good.
I have created a cool programm using GTP and the Ollama library to generate question from simples question for my dataset

questions_fr = [
    "Quand a eu lieu la Révolution française ?",
    "Qui était Napoléon Bonaparte ?"
]
Edit : there is 60 simple questions in the programm.

I tried all these questions after 2 hours and at 20%. I'm going to reduce the questions to do tests. I'm only taking 5.

I'm going to set up another PC to be able to do this more efficiently.

I did set up an other computer. I lauche the programm on it to generate the dataset, hopefully it should be done tomorrow.
