I decided to take everything from 0.

Found a cool video to get refamiliarized with the framwork. 
Frist thing frist unsloth is not a finetuning tool. it is an optimiser. It rewritte certaine pytorch function / operation to make them faster.

I try to create a programm to test the model. I failed.

I dived into the frameworks for finetuning found 2 other : MLX et axolotl ( that I already knew )

MLX is specific for apple : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCfCdTp-fdM
	So no MLX, whith is sad because is seems realy preforment.

I will look at axolotl : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj44Bt9UxYQ
	Sound really simple ( this is a no code framwork ) and can work with multipel GPU.
	
After having done the yml for the finetuning. It is really hard to make it work.

Took this as an exemple : https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl/blob/main/examples/mistral/config.yml 
And ask IA ChatGPT friend to help me. But for know we didn't successed.


------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------------


Mickael just gave me instruction for my task. I need to do a question decomposer model.

At the question: When has the WW2 started and why ? Can you explain me ?
The model should anwser: {question: When has the WW2 started}{question: Why has the WW2 started}

I was given the tool Qwent to create datasets. I will invertigatenow. I am stoping axolotl. I am making the the dataset a priority.

Chat GPT is suggesting me to use a LLM to help me to create the dataset. I could ... but I think I wil look at thee existing dataset on huggingface first. I may get ideas.
