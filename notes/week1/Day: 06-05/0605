A College gave me a code to finetune a model using Unsloth. My job is to understand it.

I had issues with my NVIDIA driver. The installation of the dependencies has proved to be harder than I thought.

After a meal break, I decided to rely more on the Unsloth Google Colab and ChatGPT to learn the basics first ( yeah I am understand almost nothing ).

I had other issues with dependency problems when using ChatGPT.

I found the issue with my Unsloth installation here: https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/1030.

Now I must find why my NVIDIA driver is not recognized by Unsloth.

OKKKKKKKK—I had a fuc... : a gentle issue named “Security boot enable” which prevented me and Unsloth from using my GPU. I disabled it, and it seems to work.

I generated a dataset of simple exemple followinf this  https://github.com/vossenwout/llm-finetuning-resources/tree/main.

Training seems long on my 7.6 GB GPU but not impossible.
For a dataset of 10 000 lines of (‘user’ → ‘response’):
