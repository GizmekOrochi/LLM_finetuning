College gaved me a code to finetune a model using unsloth. My job is to understand it.

I had issu with my invidia driver. the installation of the dependencies has proved to be harder than I thought.

After meal break I decided to rely more of the unsloth google colab and Chat GPT to learn the basics first.

Had oder issues with problem of dependancies preblem with chat GPT

Found the issue with my unsloth installation here "https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/1030".

Now I must find why my invidia driver is no reconized by unsloth

OKKKKKKKK I had a FOJHBHJHGUYTGIY7TUVYUH. A gentle issue name "Security boot unable" with prevent me and unsloth for using my GPU. I disabled it and it seems to work.

Training seem long on my 7.6 GB GPU but not impossible.
