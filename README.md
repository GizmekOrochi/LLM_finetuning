# LLM_finetuning
This repository is part of my internship project, capturing the journey and experimentation involved in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).

    In the Notes folder, you’ll find my personal entries—essentially a running journal of my work. Each note captures what I worked on that day (tasks completed, challenges encountered, ideas that came up, next steps, etc.), so you can trace the evolution of each project over time.
    
    WARNING : This internships was in a french lab, there is french language in the datasets and LLM context / prompt. But the rest is perfectly readable.
